# PMP Support Site

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/npr/pmp-support-site.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/npr/pmp-support-site)

Rails application powering [support.pmp.io](https://support.pmp.io).

The support.pmp.io site provides links and information for getting help with the PMP.

Documentation is parsed from the markdown files in the `docs` directory.  They will be sorted by name before being rendered as the docs page.

## Running

In order to really get this thing cooking, you need to provide several environment variables.  Firstly: `cp .env.example .env`

Then you need PMP admin credentials to be able to reset user passwords, set the following variables on the recent generated `.env` file.

```
SANDBOX_CLIENT_ID=the-sand-admin-client-id
SANDBOX_CLIENT_SECRET=the-sand-admin-client-secret
PRODUCTION_CLIENT_ID=the-prod-admin-client-id
PRODUCTION_CLIENT_SECRET=the-prod-admin-client-secret
```

Secondly, you'll need some production, `READ-ONLY` credentials for the public API proxy:

```
PRODUCTION_PUBLIC_ID=some-prod-client-id
PRODUCTION_PUBLIC_SECRET=some-prod-client-secret
```

## Testing

This app is currently 100% non-recorded integration tests. So you'll need to provide a PMP login (as if you were a user logging into the site). To do so firstly: `cp .env.test.example .env.test`, you need to set the following variables on `.env.test`

```
PMP_HOST=https://api-sandbox.pmp.io
PMP_USERNAME=pmpuser94
PMP_PASSWORD=p&ssw0rd
bundle exec rake
```

## Making updates to support.pmp.io

The process:
1. Make changes and submit a pull request on GitHub (https://github.com/npr/pmp-support-site).
1. Please turn on notifications for the repo if you havenâ€™t done so.
1. NPR DevOps will merge the pull request.
1. NPR DevOps will pull the changes down on the server and clear cache/restart service so they take effect.

To deploy the changes:
- ssh -i /path/to/pmp_key ec2-user@support.pmp.io
- sudo su - pmpbot
- cd ~/support.pmp.io
- git pull
- `bundle exec` (if Gemfile or Gemfile.lock was updated)
- `rake db:migrate` (if new files in db/migrate/)
- RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake assets:precompile
- RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake tmp:cache:clear
- exit
- sudo restart unicorn.support

Notice that this will skip several tests.  To get a full-run, you'll also need to set "public" credentials, and "admin" credentials for whatever `PMP_HOST` you're using.  (As detailed in the "Running" section above).  Don't have admin access?  Not to worry - Travis CI will do a complete test run.
